						Weâ€™re Mark and Anthony dela Torre, two brothers, set on creating a
						sustainable home-place, and sharing our journey with others. In the
						summer of 2019 we began with limited resources and endless
						determination. We planted our first batch of hop rhizomes on our
						newly acquired family farm. Around that time, there was a worldwide
						shortage of hops, coupled with ever growing demand from the craft
						brewing industry; we set our focus on the feasibility of small scale
						hops production in Western NC. As we celebrate the farm now being
						over 10 years old, we have learned a lot of valuable lessons. Every
						year brings new challenges, excitement, and opportunities. During
						the last ten years, we have developed a holistic approach to our
						farm and the life cycle we choose to pursue. Our current focus is on
						sustainable hemp & hops production, pastured poultry, hogs, and
						select produce cultivation.
						<span class="text-warning">VerdeValle Farms </span>has become more
						than a place to call home; it represents community, creativity, and
						our best effort to connect people with a sustainable family farm
						experience.
