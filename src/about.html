        <p>Weâ€™re Mark and Anthony dela Torre, two brothers, set on creating a sustainable home-place, and sharing our journey
          with others.
      
          In the summer of 2019 we began with limited resources and endless determination. We planted our first batch of hop
          rhizomes on our newly acquired family farm. Around that time, there was a worldwide shortage of hops, coupled with
          ever growing demand from the craft brewing industry; we set our focus on the feasibility of small scale hops
          production in Western NC.
      
          As we celebrate the farm now being over 10 years old, we have learned a lot of valuable lessons. Every year brings
          new challenges, excitement, and opportunities. During the last ten years, we have developed a holistic approach to
          our farm and the life cycle we choose to pursue. Our current focus is on sustainable hemp & hops production,
          pastured poultry, hogs, and select produce cultivation. <span class="text-warning">VerdeValle Farms </span>has become more than a place to call
          home; it represents community, creativity, and our best effort to connect people with a sustainable family farm
          experience.
